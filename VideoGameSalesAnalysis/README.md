Video Game Sales Analysis

Project Objective
This project analyzes video game sales data to uncover actionable trends, preferences, and strategic insights for the gaming industry.  The goal is to inform game development, marketing, and platform strategies, enabling stakeholders to adapt to market shifts and evolving player preferences.

Dataset
* Source: "Video Games Sales" dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)
* Description: Contains data on video games with sales exceeding 100,000 copies. Includes fields such as Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, and regional sales figures.
* Time Period Covered: [Insert the start and end years of your dataset]

Analysis Process
1. Data Preprocessing (Excel)
    * Removed rows with missing critical values (Year, sales figures).
    * Calculated essential metrics for preliminary analysis.
2. Exploratory Analysis (Excel)
    * Created pivot tables to understand relationships between variables.
3. In-Depth Visualization & Insights (Tableau)
    * Imported dataset into Tableau.
    * Developed charts and dashboards, including: * Genre sales by region analysis (stacked bar charts). * Platform market share visualizations (treemaps, bar charts). * Genre-platform relationship exploration (with a focus on top platforms). * Sales trends over time for specific genres and platforms, with a deep dive into the Shooter genre's evolution.

Key Insights
* Overall Performance: Action Adventure games show strong, consistent performance globally. Role-Playing titles dominate the Japanese market.
* Platform Dominance: PlayStation platforms have historically significant market share. Handheld platforms saw substantial presence, especially in earlier dataset years. PC holds a consistent market share.
* Genre-Platform Dynamics: Specific platforms show strengths in certain genres (Wii/Sports, Xbox 360/Shooters). The PS3 interestingly shows a change in genre rankings compared to predecessors.
* Genre Trends Several top-performing genres exhibit declines in sales in recent years, warranting further exploration of market shifts and potential external factors.

Future Analysis
* Mobile Gaming Impact: Investigate the effect of mobile gaming rise on traditional console/PC game sales.
* Genre Deep Dives: Analyze subgenres, franchises, and trends within top-performing genres for more granular insights.
* Publisher Analysis: Explore the role of top publishers in PlayStation's historical success.
